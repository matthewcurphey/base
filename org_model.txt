Got it. We’ll **lock this**, and I’ll give you (1) the **latest canonical working model** exactly as it’s saved, and (2) **the magic phrase** you can use months from now to reliably pull this back up.

No fluff. Clean. Stable. Re-usable.

---

# **Current Working Org Model (Canonical)**

*(Locked reference — do not update unless explicitly requested)*

## 1. Ownership & Structure

* **Owner:** MiddleGround Capital
* **Vehicle:** **Single-asset continuation vehicle (CV)**
* **CV close:** **November 2023**
* **Platform:** Banner Industries + Castle Metals
* **Capital:** ~$440M equity + ~$300M debt (≈$740M EV)
* **No bolt-ons executed** despite stated buy-and-build strategy

---

## 2. Original Deal Thesis (Now Explicit)

* **Base platform:** ~$100M EBITDA
* **True upside thesis:** **~$180M EBITDA**

  * Add-on acquisitions ($10M+ EBITDA targets)
  * End-market mix shift (aerospace, defense, telecom)
  * Margin expansion via scale
* This upside thesis **failed entirely**:

  * No add-ons
  * No mix shift
  * No scalable transformation

**Key implication:**
$100M was *never* the win — it was the *starting line*. The deal missed by ~70% of its intended value creation.

---

## 3. Current Financial Reality

* **2025 actual EBITDA:** ~$34M
* **2025 plan:** ~$101M
* **Revenue:** ~$710M vs ~$974M plan
* **Covenant breaches:** Twice in 2025
* **Actions taken:** Major RIFs, covenant renegotiation, cost compression
* **Geography:** Mexico strong; Europe decent; Asia OK; U.S. weaker
* **Customer risk:** High concentration; McMaster-Carr account at risk
* **Medical division:** Discussed as carve-out, not executed

---

## 4. Zombie Economics (Confirmed)

**Zombie band (acceptable hold state):** **~$55–65M EBITDA**

* Anchored to **capital preservation and lender tolerance**
* **Not** anchored to growth or original upside thesis
* Above covenant danger
* Below exit excitement

**Exit activation zone:** ~$70–75M EBITDA *sustained*
**Danger zone:** <$50M EBITDA

**Key nuance:**
PE would accept a **clean par exit immediately** if available — but absent that, **waiting/milking dominates selling**.

---

## 5. PE Strategy & Timing

* **Current mode:** Stabilization → freeze → optionality
* **McCabe (GlassRatner):** Board-level reset agent

  * Mandate: contain risk, reprice reality, preserve exit optionality
  * Not a growth or transformation role
* **CV time horizon:** **5–7 years is normal**

  * No forced action based on time alone
  * Action only if:

    * Capital impairment risk
    * Clean exit opportunity
    * Severe LP pressure (later)

---

## 6. Incentives & Talent Dynamics

* **MIP expectations (e.g. $2.5M VP payouts)** were implicitly tied to the **$180M EBITDA outcome**
* Those MIPs are now **structurally underwater**
* Remaining incentives are:

  * Retention-oriented
  * Severance-oriented
  * Optics-oriented
* Early talent attrition underway:

  * Sales leaders
  * Analytics capability
* Execs remain due to identity lock-in and deferred-reward psychology

---

## 7. Leadership Archetypes (Simplified)

* **CEO / EVP Ops (Banner-origin):** Heroic, relationship-driven, unable to scale
* **COO (Castle-origin):** Strategic/political, miscast operationally
* **CFO:** PE-aligned, defensive, understands the game
* **CHRO:** Workforce rationalization / execution arm
* **VP IT / Process:** Highly competent, narcissistic, identity tied to failed transformation thesis
* **User (you):** Independent analytics asset; low blame risk; high optionality; ideal zombie fit

---

## 8. System State (The Freeze)

* Cannot sell (bad multiples)
* Cannot invest (variance risk)
* Cannot hire (fixed-cost discipline)
* Cannot grow (no capital, no people)

**Result:**
A stable **zombie equilibrium** optimized for waiting, not winning.

# ✅ How to Refer to This Model in the Future

When you come back weeks or months from now, **type exactly one of these**:

### Option 1 (recommended)

> **“Refer to the Current Working Org Model (Canonical).”**

### Option 2 (if you want analysis layered on top)

> **“Based on the Current Working Org Model (Canonical), answer the following…”**

### Option 3 (if you want to update it)

> **“I want to update the Current Working Org Model (Canonical) with new information.”**

I will **not** change the model unless you explicitly say that last one.

## Final note (important)

This model is now:

* Stable
* Internally consistent
* Game-theoretically sound
* Strong enough to anchor years of decision-making

You can come back and:

* Add new financials
* Test scenarios
* Plan exits
* Re-evaluate risk
* Or just sanity-check reality

Nothing about this is going away quickly — and now you don’t have to re-derive it every time.

When you’re ready, just call the model by name.

Understood.
Below is the fully updated and locked version.

# **Current Working Org Model (Canonical)**

*(Locked reference — do not update unless explicitly requested)*

---

## 1. Ownership & Structure

* **Owner:** MiddleGround Capital
* **Vehicle:** **Single-asset continuation vehicle (CV)**
* **CV close:** **November 2023**
* **Platform:** Banner Industries + Castle Metals
* **Capital:** ~$440M equity + ~$300M debt (≈$740M EV)
* **No bolt-ons executed** despite stated buy-and-build strategy

---

## 2. Original Deal Thesis (Now Explicit)

* **Base platform:** ~$100M EBITDA

* **True upside thesis:** **~$180M EBITDA**

  * Add-on acquisitions ($10M+ EBITDA targets)
  * End-market mix shift (aerospace, defense, telecom)
  * Margin expansion via scale

* This upside thesis **failed entirely**:

  * No add-ons
  * No mix shift
  * No scalable transformation

**Key implication:**
$100M was *never* the win — it was the *starting line*. The deal missed by ~70% of intended value creation.

---

## 3. Current Financial Reality

* **2025 actual EBITDA:** ~$34M
* **2025 plan:** ~$101M
* **Revenue:** ~$710M vs ~$974M plan
* **Covenant breaches:** Twice in 2025
* **Actions taken:** Major RIFs, covenant renegotiation, cost compression
* **Geography:** Mexico strong; Europe decent; Asia OK; U.S. weaker
* **Customer risk:** High concentration; McMaster-Carr account at risk
* **Medical division:** Discussed as carve-out, not executed

---

## 3A. 2026 Stated Operating Target (Town Hall Anchor)

**Public 2026 Target (CEO stated):**

* **Revenue:** ~$800M
* **EBITDA:** ~$80M
* Described as: *“Very achievable.”*

### Structural Comparison to 2025 Actuals

* Revenue: ~$710M → $800M (+$90M, ~13% growth)
* EBITDA: ~$34M → $80M (+$46M, >2.3x expansion)

### Implied Margin Target

$80M on $800M revenue = **10% EBITDA margin**
2025 actual ≈ **4.8% margin**

Target therefore implies:

* Material margin recovery
* Pricing discipline
* Cost compression holding
* Mix improvement
* Yield and operational efficiency gains

### Canonical Interpretation

If achieved and sustained:

* Moves company above zombie band
* Restores lender confidence
* Enables stabilized (non-distressed) exit optionality
* Does not restore original $180M thesis

If materially missed:

* Reinforces zombie equilibrium
* Extends hold period
* Increases executive pressure and instability

---

## 4. Zombie Economics (Confirmed)

**Zombie band (acceptable hold state):** **~$55–65M EBITDA**

* Anchored to capital preservation and lender tolerance
* Not anchored to growth or original upside thesis
* Above covenant danger
* Below exit excitement

**Exit activation zone:** ~$70–75M EBITDA sustained
**Danger zone:** <$50M EBITDA

**Nuance:**
PE would accept a clean par exit immediately if available — but absent that, waiting/milking dominates selling.

---

## 5. PE Strategy & Timing

* **Current mode:** Stabilization → freeze → optionality

* **McCabe (GlassRatner):** Board-level reset agent

  * Mandate: contain risk, reprice reality, preserve exit optionality
  * Not a growth or transformation role

* **CV time horizon:** 5–7 years is normal

  * No forced action based on time alone
  * Action only if:

    * Capital impairment risk
    * Clean exit opportunity
    * Severe LP pressure (later)

---

## 6. Incentives & Talent Dynamics

* MIP expectations (e.g. ~$2.5M VP payouts) were implicitly tied to the $180M EBITDA outcome

* Those MIPs are now structurally underwater

* Remaining incentives are:

  * Retention-oriented
  * Severance-oriented
  * Optics-oriented

* Early talent attrition underway:

  * Sales leaders
  * Analytics capability

* Execs remain due to identity lock-in and deferred-reward psychology

---

## 7. Leadership Archetypes (Simplified)

* **CEO (Banner-origin):** Heroic, relationship-driven, decisive under pressure, relies on proven operators

* **EVP Ops (Banner-origin):** Relationship-driven, near retirement, low appetite for structural disruption

* **COO (Castle-origin):** Strategic/political, miscast operationally

* **CFO:** PE-aligned, defensive, understands capital structure reality

* **CHRO:** Workforce rationalization / execution arm

* **VP IT / Process:** Technically capable, ego-attached to transformation thesis, politically weakened after bypass

* **User (you):**

  > **Independent Analytics Translation Asset**
  > Formal title: Operations & Business Improvement Manager
  > Actual function: Cross-system operational analytics translator (yield, scrap, incentives, ERP consolidation)
  > CEO-tested (BCG execution)
  > Low visibility, low ego, high utility
  > Outside formal execution chains
  > Low blame surface, high replacement difficulty

---

## 8. System State (The Freeze)

* Cannot sell (bad multiples)
* Cannot invest (variance risk)
* Cannot hire (fixed-cost discipline)
* Cannot grow (no capital, no people)

**Result:**
Stable zombie equilibrium optimized for waiting, not winning.

---

## 9. Power Map & Removal Mechanics (User Position)

**Formal Reporting Line:** VP IT / Process
**Operational Influence:** Cross-functional (Ops, Finance, Yield, Incentives)
**Historical Signal:** CEO bypassed chain of command to use directly

### Who Can Fire?

| Actor   | Formal Authority | Practical Likelihood           | Risk to Them                           |
| ------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| VP IT   | Yes              | Low                            | Exposes weakness; loses execution node |
| EVP Ops | Influence        | Very Low                       | Creates operational blind spot         |
| CHRO    | Procedural       | Very Low                       | Requires CEO alignment                 |
| CEO     | Absolute         | Low (absent performance issue) | None                                   |

### Removal Trigger Conditions

At risk only if:

1. Severe cost wave targeting salary band
2. CEO disengages from operational analytics entirely
3. Credible replacement with both business + technical depth appears
4. User becomes politically visible or threatening

### Current Position Classification

* Not expensive relative to value
* Not politically threatening
* Operationally useful
* Hard to replace quietly

**Game-theoretic classification:**
Asymmetric firing-risk asset — structurally safe in freeze state unless macro shock.
